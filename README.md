Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand what drives the price of a car by analyzing a dataset from Kaggle containing roughly 426,000 entries. We processed and cleaned the data, normalized it, and ran predictive models to identify the factors that influence car prices. The final goal was to prepare a comprehensive report for a car dealership to assist them in understanding how different attributes affect car prices.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains various details about cars, including features such as:

    Manufactured Year
    Make and Model
    Odometer reading
    Price (target variable)
    Condition of the car, etc.

Key Objectives

    Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
        Handle missing data, correct erroneous entries, and normalize numerical features.
        Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Analyze trends, distributions, and relationships between different features and the target variable (price).
        Visualize key correlations to identify patterns.

    Modeling:
        Build and train multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and Ridge Regression.
        Use performance metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to evaluate the models' accuracy.
        Compare the predicted values with the actual values to assess model quality.

    Report:
        Prepare a final report for a car dealership outlining key findings from the analysis.
        Offer insights into which features influence the price of cars and recommend actions to help improve pricing strategies.
